## Usage
**Example**
```bash
from equation_solver import LinearEquation, QuadraticEquation, solver

# Create and solve equations
lin = LinearEquation(2, 3)  # 2x + 3 = 0
quad = QuadraticEquation(1, -5, 6)  # x¬≤ -5x + 6 = 0

print(solver(lin))
print(solver(quad))

# Direct access to solutions
print(lin.solve())  # [-1.5]
print(quad.solve())  # [3.0, 2.0]

# Equation analysis
print(lin.analyze())  # {'slope': 2, 'intercept': 3}
print(quad.analyze())  # Vertex, concavity info
```
**Output Format**
**Solutions are presented in a clean format:**
```bash
---Linear Equation---

       2x +3 = 0        

-------Solutions-------

       x = -1.500       

-------Details-------

slope =            2.000
y-intercept =      3.000
